# Week 7 Ethics Response
### Question:
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
---
### 1) Report your concerns of this scenario to management and request to have the project reviewed before implementation.
---
### Pros
1) Ensuring Quality: By requesting a review, we can ensure that the software meets the required standards and doesn't have any hidden flaws or biases.
2) Protecting Company Reputation: Taking proactive steps to verify the software's integrity can prevent potential issues down the line, safeguarding the company's reputation.
3) Fostering Trust: Demonstrating diligence and responsibility in addressing concerns can foster trust within the team and with stakeholders.

### Cons
1) Time Delay: Requesting a review may delay the project's implementation, potentially causing inconvenience to the company.
2) Might ruin a Relationship: Reporting concerns about a friend's work to management might strain the relationship with the junior engineer.
3) Perceived Lack of Confidence: Management might perceive the request for a review as a lack of confidence in the junior engineer's abilities, leading to tension.

### Scripture
>“For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?” - Luke 14:28
## Script
**Me:** "I've noticed some aspects of the project that concern me. I think it would be wise to have a thorough review before integrating it into major systems."

**Management:** "We appreciate your diligence. Let's schedule a review to ensure everything is in order."

**Me:** "Thank you for considering my concerns."
### Principle: Upholding standards of integrity and quality, even if it means raising uncomfortable topics.
---
### 2) Do nothing and allow the junior engineer to shoulder the responsibility.
---
### Pros
1) Maintaining Friendship: Avoiding confrontation may help preserve the friendship with the junior engineer.
2) Avoiding Conflict: Taking no action can prevent potential conflict or tension within the team.
3) Respecting Autonomy: Respecting the junior engineer's autonomy and decisions can foster a sense of trust and empowerment.

### Cons
1) Risk to Company: Allowing potentially flawed software to be implemented without review could pose significant risks to the company's operations and reputation.
2) Ethical Concerns: Failing to address potential issues with the software goes against ethical principles of integrity and responsibility.
3) Long-term Consequences: Ignoring the problem now may lead to bigger challenges in the future if the software causes issues down the line.

### Scripture
>“For each will have to bear his own load.” – Galatians 6:5
## Script
**Me:** "I noticed some areas of concern but I trust your judgment on this."

**Junior:** "Thanks for trusting me, I'll make sure everything is fine."

**Me:** "Alright, let me know if you need any assistance."
### Principle: Balancing friendship with professional responsibilities while respecting individual autonomy.
---
### 3) Consult with the junior engineer about his understanding of the project before going to management.
---
### Pros
1) Clarification: Consulting with the junior engineer can provide insights into their understanding of the project and the AI's contribution.
2) Building Trust: Engaging in dialogue shows respect for the junior engineer's work and fosters trust within the team.
3) Potential Resolution: Discussing concerns together may lead to a collaborative solution that addresses any shortcomings in the project.

### Cons
1) Incomplete Understanding: The junior engineer may not fully grasp the implications of the AI's contributions, leading to potential blind spots.
2) Time Consuming: Engaging in discussions may take time, delaying the resolution of the issue.
3) Uncertain Outcome: There's no guarantee that the discussion will lead to a satisfactory resolution or address all concerns.

### Scripture
>“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.” - Hebrews 10:24-25
## Script
**Me:** "I've noticed some aspects of the project that concern me. Can we discuss your understanding of the AI's contributions?"

**Junior:** "Sure, let's go through it together."

**Me:** "I appreciate your insights. Let's consider how we can address these concerns before involving management."
### Principle: Seeking understanding and collaboration as a means to address concerns and find solutions together.

### **Conclusion**
Considering all the factors involved, it's clear that this situation presents a tough call. But as a Christian, I would argue that it's crucial to stay true to principles like honesty, accountability, and respect for others.
While each option has its upsides and downsides, the bottom line is making sure the software's quality isn't compromised and that relationships stay intact within the team.
